# Sample Technical Documentation page (Ruby documentation)

This project is a demonstration of the basic HTML and CSS skills I've learned as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.

This static HTML/CSS page mainly shows the applied skills of building an online technical documentation page. The page includes a vertical fixed left navigation bar with links to each section of the main documentation. 

The CSS properties used on this landing page include the use of the Flexbox model
